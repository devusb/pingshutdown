# pingshutdown
`pingshutdown` can be used to shutdown a host when another remote host is no longer responding to ping.

A potential use of this is safely shutting down a host connected to a UPS on power failure. While many UPSes work with `apcupsd` or `nut` to provide this notification, `pingshutdown` can be used in any hardware configuration.
